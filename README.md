An early version of the Holochain hApp store.

This version exists to allow participants of the Holo closed alpha program to find and install DNAs to host.

---

## Test DNA
`make test`

## Building and Running

### Build Holochain DNA

The DNA builds with Holochain. Ensure you have the holochain developer cli `hc` and holochain conductor `holochain` installed that match this version.  The simplest way to ensure this is to use holoportos' Nix configuration, and then (once a compatible Nix environment has been created), running `make install` to build into `hApp-store/dist/hApp-store.dna.json`

```
$ git clone git@github.com:holochain/hApp-store.git
$ cd hApp-store
$ nix-shell
[nix-shell:~/src/hApp-store]$ make install
$ make install
mkdir -p hApp-store/dist/
cd hApp-store && hc package --output dist/hApp-store.dna.json --strip-meta
> cargo build --release --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown
...
Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.06s
Created DNA package file at "dist/hApp-store.dna.json"
DNA hash: Qmd6pArbijQ3ija5FnyrMaZirXJL83afbj8DJGuAENAdM9
```

Holochain DNA Rust Unit tests and Node Scenario tests can be run:

```
[nix-shell:~/src/hAPp-store]$ make test
...
✓ add Category
✓ Create an app, add dna+ui bundles and retrieve
✓ Create an app, add dna+ui bundles and retrieve
✓ get user address
# tests 18
# pass  18
✓ ok
```

### Build UI

Ensure `npm` is installed and run

```
npm run build
```

This will build the UI into the `ui/` directory

### Running in the Holochain conductor

Ensure the holochain conductor binary is on your path and run the npm helper script

```
npm run hc:start
```

Alternatively you can start it using the conductor directly by running

```
holochain -c ./conductor-config.toml
```
